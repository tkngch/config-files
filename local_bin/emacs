# If LC_CTYPE is English, you may not be able to use input method in emacs due
# to an old emacs bug. You can set LC_CTYPE to something else such as
# zh_CN.UTF-8 before emacs starts to get rid of this problem.

# Note that the corresponding locale should be uncommented in /etc/locale.gen
# and locale-gen should be run as su.
